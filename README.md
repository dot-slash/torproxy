# torproxy #
A transparent TOR proxying app for Gnome Desktop on Debian-based systems.

Currently just a working prototype.

#### Installation: ####

Go to the extensions folder:
`$ cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

Make a new folder called `torproxy@dot.slash`:
`$ mkdir torproxy@dot.slash`

Copy the files into this new folder. Activate via the Gnome Tweak Tool under the Extensions tab.
